<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sebastian Nieves and welcome to my first ever website. I am a second year computer science student, I go to Universidad Politecninca 
    de Puerto Rico. I am striving to be a programmer whether that be as a software engineer, web devolper, cloud engineer or cyber security specialist.

</p>

</p>I come from a science background as I also have a bachellors in biology, where I worked mainly on e
nviromentalist roles and did my undergrad research working with Vida Marina. They are a conservation program owned by 
University of Puerto Rico Aguadilla where I studied, and their goal is to protect and restore marine life on the island. 
My research there consisted of dune and mangrove restoration in the beaches of Isabela, where me and my colleagues worked 
hard all summer planting magroves, restoring dunes, building paths etc.

<p>After I was done, even though 
    I loved my time there and felt satisfied with my work I realized that my calling 
    was in tech. Ever since I was a kid i was fascinated with electronics, video games, 
    etc. I was the kid that would run his own minecraft server off a home computer, 
    I started modding my consoles and eventually started building my own pc's, which 
    is a hobby I still pursue which is further strengthened by my love of video games.
     So in August of 2024 I decided to join PUPR (my current campus) and starrt in computer science 
     where I am currently learning web development and hopefully my talent and interests continue to 
     grow and expand. This is a piece of the beginning of my journey so I hope you enjoy!</p>
